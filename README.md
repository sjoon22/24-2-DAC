# PPT-Application: AI-Powered Position / Pose Reconstruction System

### ðŸš€ Project Summary
PPT-Application is an AI-powered image editing tool that allows users to seamlessly modify subject poses and positions in photos. This cutting-edge solution goes beyond traditional photo editing features to offer an intuitive, high-quality experience for both individual and professional users.

-------

### Key Features
- **Pose Transfer**: Automatically modifies a person's pose based on a reference image.
- **Inpainting**: Smoothly fills background after separating the subject.
- **Repositioning**: Places the pose-modified subject into a specified location within the image.

PPT-Application's base model is from 
[Roy et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06777), [code](https://github.com/prasunroy/pose-transfer?tab=readme-ov-file), and we fine-tune it with an additional [dataset](https://www.aihub.or.kr/aihubdata/data/view.do?currMenu=115&topMenu=100&aihubDataSe=data&dataSetSn=71704) for multiracial transformation.
