# PPT-Application: AI-Powered Position / Pose Reconstruction System

### üöÄ Project Summary
PPT-Application is an AI-powered image editing tool that allows users to seamlessly modify subject poses and positions in photos. This cutting-edge solution goes beyond traditional photo editing features to offer an intuitive, high-quality experience for both individual and professional users.

-------

### Key Features
- **Pose Transfer**: Automatically modifies a person's pose based on a reference image.
- **Inpainting**: Smoothly fills background after separating the subject.
- **Repositioning**: Places the pose-modified subject into a specified location within the image.

## üèÅ Conclusion and Future Work

The PPT-Application project aimed to develop an AI-powered system capable of transforming subject poses and naturally merging them into high-quality reconstructed images. In a society where the demand for personalized content creation and image editing efficiency is rapidly increasing, this project sought to revolutionize image editing quality and productivity.
Despite promising advancements, the project faced notable challenges:

### Achievements
- Successfully implemented an **End-to-End Image Editing System** integrating Segmentation and Inpainting technologies.
- Utilized **BiRefNet** for high-precision segmentation and **Stability API** for efficient inpainting with high-resolution outputs.

### Limitations
1. **Pose Transfer Issues**:
   - Domain mismatch caused the model to retain foreign facial features when applied to local subjects.
   - Repositioning errors resulted in visual misalignments and artifacts.

   #### Example:
   **Successful Pose Transfer (Foreign Subject)**

   **Failed Pose Transfer (Local Subject)**

   **After Fine-tuned**

2. **Processing Speed Constraints**:
   - CPU-based processing averaged 60 seconds per image, limiting real-time usability.

### Future Directions
- Enhance **data diversity** by incorporating more inclusive datasets to improve model generalization.
- Transition to **Diffusion Models** for more adaptable and higher-quality pose transformations.
- Adopt GPU-based processing to reduce latency and improve user experience.
- Expand functionalities for multi-subject editing and advanced lighting adjustments.

PPT-Application's base Transfer model is from 
[Roy et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06777), [code](https://github.com/prasunroy/pose-transfer?tab=readme-ov-file), and we fine-tune it with an additional [dataset](https://www.aihub.or.kr/aihubdata/data/view.do?currMenu=115&topMenu=100&aihubDataSe=data&dataSetSn=71704) for multiracial transformation.
